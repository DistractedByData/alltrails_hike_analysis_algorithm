# alltrails_hike_analysis_algorithm
 
By running this python script you can generate 4 data vizualizations from an Alltrails csv file.

I will be posting  a video soon walking through an example.

Checkout the [code here](https://github.com/SoManyDistractions/alltrails_hike_analysis_algorithm/blob/main/hike_algo.py), and feel free to download it and try it on your own alltrails data.
